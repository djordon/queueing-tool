Queueing-tool
=============

|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |pyversion| |license|

Queueing-tool is a package for simulating and analyzing networks. It is an
event based simulator that uses
`queues <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory>`__ to simulate congestion
and waiting on the network that includes tools for
visualizing network dynamics.

Documentation
-------------

The package documentation can be found at
http://queueing-tool.readthedocs.org/.

Features
--------

-  **Fast simulation**. Queueing-tool is designed to run very quickly;
   the core algorithms were written in `cython <http://cython.org/>`__.
-  **Visualizations**. There are several tools that allow you to easily
   view congestion and movement within your network. This includes ready
   made functions for animating network dynamics, while your simulations
   take place.
-  **Full documentation**. Every function and class is fully documented
   both `online <http://queueing-tool.readthedocs.org/>`__ and in the
   docstrings.
-  **Fast setup**. The network is represented as a
   `networkx graph <http://networkx.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__.
   Queueing-tool networks allow for probabilistic routing, finite
   capacity queues, and different blocking protocols for analyzing
   `loss networks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_network>`__.

Installation
------------


**Prerequisites:** Queueing-tool runs on Python 2.7 and 3.3-3.5 and it
requires `networkx <http://networkx.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__ and
`numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__. If you want to plot, you will need
to install `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ as well.

**Installation**: To install from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/queueing-tool>`__ use:

.. code:: bash

    pip install queueing-tool

The above will automatically install networkx and numpy. If you want to install
all optional packages, use:

.. code:: bash

    pip install numpy matplotlib pygraphviz
    pip install queueing-tool

After installation, import with something like:

.. code:: python

    import queueing_tool as qt
