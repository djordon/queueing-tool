=============

Queueing-tool is a package for simulating and analyzing networks of
[queues][] that is written in Python. It also includes a visualization
component for seeing network dynamics.

Features
--------

-   **Easy to use**. The setup process is designed to be quick and
    painless, while still giving you complete control over the design of
    your network. This allows you to design your queueing networks
    quickly, which comes in handy when modeling and analyzing larger
    networks.
-   **Large feature set**. You can use general functions (including time
    dependent functions) for the arrival and departure functions for
    each queue. Queueing-tool also includes allows for probabilistic
    routing for modeling [Jackson networks][], finite capacity queues
    and 2 different blocking protocols for studying [loss networks][],
    as well as specialty queues for modeling more exotic networks.
-   **Fast simulation**. Queueing-tool is designed to run very quickly.
    The core algorithms were written using [cython][], which exports
    C-extensions of these routines, and the underlying graph utilizes
    [graph-tool][], a fast and powerful graph package.
-   **Beautiful visualizations**. There are several tools that allow you
    to easily view congestion and movement within your network. This
    includes ready made functions for animating network dynamics, such
    as congestion, while your simulations take place. These features use
    graph-toolâ€™s powerful visualization capabilities and can accommodate
    many of its visualization features.
-   **Full documentation**. Every function and class is fully documented
    both [online][] and in the docstrings. There are also worked out
    examples included in the source.

Installation
------------

**Prerequisites:** Queueing-tool runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4 and it
requires [graph-tool][] and [numpy][]. It should work on Python 3.2
and 3.3 as well but it has not been tested in those environments.

**Platforms**: Queueing tool should work on Windows and any unix-like
platform such as Linux or Mac OS X. The developers of [numpy][2]
have compiled binary packages for Windows, Mac OS X, and
several other unix-like operating systems, while the developers of
[graph-tool][1] have made binaries for Mac OS X and several linux
distributions but not Windows.

**Manual installation**: Download the latest release from github and do
the following

```bash
tar xzvf queueing_tool-[VERSION].zip
cd queueing_tool-[VERSION].zip
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```

To install locally use the following

```bash
python setup.py develop --user
```
