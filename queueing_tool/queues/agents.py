    """The base class for an agent.

    ``Agents`` are the objects that move throughout the network.
    ``Agents`` are instantiated by a queue, and once serviced the
    ``Agent`` moves on to another queue in the network. Each ``Agent``
    *decides* where in the network it wants to arrive at next but
    choosing amongst its options randomly. The probabilities are
    specified in :class:`QueueNetwork's<.QueueNetwork>` transition
    matrix. See :meth:`.set_transitions` for changing the routing
    probabilities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_id : tuple (optional, default: ``(0, 0)``)
        A unique identifier for an agent. Is set automatically by the
        :class:`.QueueServer` that instantiates the ``Agent``. The
        first slot is the :class:`QueueServer's<.QueueServer>` edge
        index and the second slot is the ``Agent's``
        instantiation number for that queue.
    **kwargs :
        Unused.

    Attributes
    ----------
    agent_id : tuple
        A unique identifier for an agent.
    blocked : int
        Specifies how many times an agent has been blocked by a finite
